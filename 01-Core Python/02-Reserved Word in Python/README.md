# Reserved Word in Python

In Python, reserved words are also known as keywords. These are special words that are reserved by the language for its syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names). Here's a list of Python keywords as of my last training data:

```python
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

These keywords serve specific purposes in Python syntax, and attempting to use them as variable names or other identifiers would result in syntax errors. It's essential to avoid naming variables or functions with these reserved words to ensure the code's correctness.
