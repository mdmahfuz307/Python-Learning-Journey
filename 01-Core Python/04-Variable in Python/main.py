In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in the computer's memory.
 Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require you to
 explicitly declare the type of a variable. Instead, the type of the variable is inferred
 from the value assigned to it. Here's how you declare and use variables in Python:

'''

# Assigning a value to a variable
my_variable = 42

# You can assign values of any data type to a variable
my_string = "Hello, world!"
my_float = 3.14
my_boolean = True

# Variables can be reassigned to new values of any type
my_variable = "New value"

# You can also assign the result of an expression to a variable
result = 10 * 2

# Variables can be used in expressions
x = 5
y = 3
z = x + y  # z will be 8

'''
Python variables are case-sensitive, meaning my_variable, My_Variable, 
and MY_VARIABLE would be considered as different variables.


Variables in Python are references to objects in memory, 
rather than containers that store data directly. This means that variables hold
references to objects,not the objects themselves. When you assign a variable to another,
you're making the variable reference the same object as the other variable,
not copying the data itself.


Understanding variables and their behavior is fundamental to programming in Python.
They allow you to store and manipulate data efficiently within your programs.
